# Theme documentation

This is a public package that can be easily updated and published to npm packages.
It is public due to the lack of internal BCC-logic and it is just a theme.

The package consists of helpers logic, that creates the navigation routes for the sidebar, and the navigation icons.
(Need to build the logic and test it.)

To test the package helpers logic you can use the command yarn test.
